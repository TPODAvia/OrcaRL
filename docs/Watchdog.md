 **It appears that the `/etc/wdogs` directory does not exist on your system. This is likely because the watchdog package is not installed by default on Ubuntu 20.04 for Jetson Nano.**

**Here are the steps to create the directory and install the necessary package:**

1. **Install the watchdog package:**

   Use the following command to install the watchdog package:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install watchdog
   ```

2. **Create the `/etc/wdogs` directory:**

   If the package installation doesn't create the directory automatically, create it manually using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /etc/wdogs
   ```

3. **Proceed with the configuration:**

   Once the directory is created, you can continue with the steps I previously provided to configure the watchdog timer by creating the `watchdog.conf` file within the `/etc/wdogs` directory.


Sure, here are the steps on how to turn on the watchdog on a Jetson Nano Ubuntu 20.04 image:

**1. Enable the watchdog kernel module**

The first step is to enable the watchdog kernel module. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal:

```
sudo nano /etc/modules
```

Add the following line to the end of the file:

```
bcm2835_wdt
```

Save the file and exit the nano editor. Then, run the following command to reload the kernel modules:

```
sudo depmod
```

**2. Configure the watchdog timer**

Once the watchdog kernel module is loaded, you need to configure the watchdog timer. You can do this by creating a file called `watchdog.conf` in the `/etc/wdogs` directory. This file should contain the following lines:

```
[Watchdog]
Timeout = 60
Boot = 0
Action = reboot
```

* `Timeout`: This is the number of seconds that the watchdog will wait before taking action. In this case, the watchdog will reboot the system if it is not pinged within 60 seconds.
* `Boot`: This setting determines whether the watchdog is enabled at boot. A value of 0 means that the watchdog is not enabled at boot, while a value of 1 means that it is enabled.
* `Action`: This setting determines what action the watchdog will take when it times out. The available options are `reboot`, `poweroff`, `halt`, and `panic`. In this case, the watchdog will reboot the system.

**3. Start the watchdog daemon**

Once the `watchdog.conf` file is created, you need to start the watchdog daemon. You can do this by running the following command:

```
sudo systemctl start watchdog
```

**4. Verify that the watchdog is running**

You can verify that the watchdog is running by running the following command:

```
sudo systemctl status watchdog
```

The output of this command should show that the watchdog is running.

**5. Ping the watchdog**

To prevent the watchdog from timing out, you need to ping it periodically. You can do this by running the following command:

```
sudo watchdogctl ping
```

You should run this command at least once every 60 seconds to prevent the watchdog from rebooting the system.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
